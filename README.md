# SigmaFold Graph Visualization

The Protein Folding Graph Network is a web application that visualizes protein folding patterns based on the HP model. The HP model simplifies protein structures to a sequence of hydrophobic (H) and polar (P) amino acids, and it has been used to study the folding patterns of proteins in various contexts.
